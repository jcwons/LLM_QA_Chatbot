# LLM Question and Answer Chatbot
In this project, I follow along *codebasics* tutorial on how to create a chatbot using LLM. I used their data base of questions and answers to train the **Google Palm** LLM together with the **HuggingFaces** embedding. All the modules are provided by the **langchain** module in python.

The final chatbot is able to look up answers in the data base and provide answers. If no match between the asked question and the data base is found, then the chat bot replies with 'I don't know'.
